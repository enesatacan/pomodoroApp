# PomodoroApp

**Pomodoro Technique Practice**

This project is a **Pomodoro Technique Application** developed to increase productivity. The Pomodoro Technique aims to boost focus and productivity by dividing work into 25-minute sessions, separated by short breaks. This app allows users to create tasks, track them, and work according to the Pomodoro cycle.

## Features

- **Task Management**: Users can create and track the tasks they need to complete.
- **Advanced Timer**: Automatic switching between work sessions and breaks based on the Pomodoro technique.
- **Short and Long Breaks**: Long breaks are taken after every 4 Pomodoro sessions.
- **Progress Tracking**: Users can see the number of Pomodoro sessions they have completed and celebrate their achievements.
- **Flexible Design**: A modern and user-friendly interface.

## Technologies Used

- **React.js**: Used to build the core structure of the application. React components and hooks were utilized to create the timer and user interface.
- **React Router**: Used for switching between different pages.
- **Custom Hooks**: Custom React hooks were created for the timer and other functionalities.
- **Local Storage**: Used to store user progress in the browser to prevent data loss.
- **CSS/Tailwind**: Applied for styling and making the application visually appealing.

## What I Learned from the Project

- **React Custom Hooks**: Learned how to modularize timer functionality and create reusable hooks.
- **Local Storage**: Gained experience in storing data in the browser so that users donâ€™t lose their progress.
